If I had to reach to a distant limb for some minor constructive criticism, perhaps I'd say a more robust training experience for users -- but they're already working on that. If you'd asked me several months ago, perhaps I'd say a more customizable visual playbook experience -- but they heard that, listened, and designed the playbooks to our needs. I expect that if you asked me a year from now, my response would assume the same structure: we identified an issue -- something that needed a little tweaking for the distinct needs of our team -- and they immediately partnered with us to create it.

Sometimes emails have mixed fonts even when the fonts looked consistent in the preview. Sorting and filtering data isn't as intuitive as I'd like.
